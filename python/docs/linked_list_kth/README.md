# Linked List KTH

[Linked List Code Challenge](https://github.com/deshondixon/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/main/python/data_structures/linked_list.py)

<!-- Description of the challenge -->

Write the following method for the Linked List class:

kth from end
argument: a number, k, as a parameter.
Return the node’s value that is k places from the tail of the linked list.
You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

## Tests

[Linked List Unit Tests](https://github.com/deshondixon/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/main/python/tests/code_challenges/test_linked_list_kth.py)

Wrote tests to prove the following functionality:

- Where k is greater than the length of the linked list
- Where k and the length of the list are the same
- Where k is not a positive integer
- Where the linked list is of a size 1
- “Happy Path” where k is not at the end, but somewhere in the middle of the linked list
