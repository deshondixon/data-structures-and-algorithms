## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

Big O Notation:

- time -  -
- space -  -

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available -->

- Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary trees as parameters.

- Using your Hashmap implementation as a part of your algorithm, return a set of values found in bot
