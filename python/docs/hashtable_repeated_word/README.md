# HashTable Repeated Word

[HashTable Repeated Word Code Challenge](https://github.com/deshondixon/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/main/python/code_challenges/hashtable_repeated_word.py)

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

- Find the first repeated word in a book.
- Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.
- Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

Big O Notation:

- time -  -
- space -  -

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Stack and Queue-->

- Write a function called repeated word that finds the first word to occur more than once in a string
  - Arguments: string
  - Return: string
