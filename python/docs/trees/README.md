## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.

Create a Binary Tree class.

Create a Binary Search Tree class
This class should be a sub-class (or your languages equivalent) of the Binary Tree Class.

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Stack and Queue-->

#### Binary Tree

- Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:
   - pre order
   - in order
   - post order

#### Binary Search Tree

- Add
  - Arguments: value
  - Return: nothing
  - Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.


- Contains
  - Argument: value
  - Returns: boolean indicating whether the value is in the tree at least once.

## Tests

[Binary Tree Unit Tests](https://github.com/deshondixon/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/main/python/tests/data_structures/test_binary_tree.py)

[Binary Search Tree Unit Tests](https://github.com/deshondixon/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/main/python/tests/data_structures/test_binary_search_tree.py)

Wrote tests to prove the following functionality:

- Can successfully instantiate an empty tree

- Can successfully instantiate a tree with a single root node

- For a Binary Search Tree, can successfully add a left child and right child properly to a node

- Can successfully return a collection from a preorder traversal

- Can successfully return a collection from an inorder traversal

- Can successfully return a collection from a postorder traversal

- Returns true	false for the contains method, given an existing or non-existing node value
