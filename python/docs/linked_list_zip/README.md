# Linked List KTH

[Linked List Code Challenge](https://github.com/deshondixon/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/main/python/data_structures/linked_list.py)

<!-- Description of the challenge -->

Write a function called zip lists

Arguments: 2 linked lists

Return: New Linked List, zipped as noted below

Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the zipped list.

Try and keep additional space down to O(1)

You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## Tests

[Linked List Unit Tests](https://github.com/deshondixon/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/main/python/tests/code_challenges/test_linked_list_zip.py)

Wrote tests to prove the following functionality:

- “Happy Path” - Expected outcome
- Expected failure
